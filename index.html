  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: January 2025</p>

  <p>
    MoraEcho is an AI conversation application. Our goal is to give users a personal and emotional conversational experience through AI models trained for different scenarios.
  </p>

  <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only the data needed to provide and improve the app, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Email (for login and account identification)</li>
    <li>Profile details provided by the user (such as name, avatar image, gender, etc.)</li>
    <li>Optional voice samples if the user chooses to use voice-based features</li>
    <li>Chat history created inside the app</li>
    <li>Basic device data such as OS version, crash logs, and analytics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Your data is used only for app functionality, such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Personalizing AI responses</li>
    <li>Account management and security</li>
    <li>Improving features and app quality</li>
    <li>Understanding usage patterns (analytics)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Conversations</h2>
  <p>
    All chats inside the app are AI-generated. You are not communicating with another person.  
    Conversations are stored only to let you continue previous chats or improve personalization.  
    We do not sell, transfer, or expose chat data to third-party marketing companies.
  </p>

  <h2>No Harmful or Misleading Content</h2>
  <p>
    The app does not provide claims of communicating with real individuals, deceased persons, spirits, or other supernatural activities.  
    All conversations are fictional and for entertainment, emotional support, or self-expression purposes only.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or trade your data.  
    Limited third-party services (like analytics, crash reporting, or AI providers) may process certain data securely for app functionality only.
  </p>

  <h2>Account Removal</h2>
  <p>
    Users can request data removal or account deletion anytime through the in-app support or our contact email.
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    The app is not intended for users under 13.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
